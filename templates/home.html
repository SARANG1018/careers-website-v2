                <p class="lead">Most career sites contain some basic information about the company, the current job
                    openings and perhaps a few pictures
                    of the workspace. Bright, though, digs into recruitment marketing and presents something not that
                    common in careers
                    pages: blog posts written by their employees. <br>The first thing you'll see when visiting this
                    careers page is a statement of this UK-based finance platform's company
                    culture followed by three core values. This shows how much emphasis MarketFinance puts on hiring
                    like-minded people.
